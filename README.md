This is the source code of the difference-of-convex programming based algorithm (termed BP, for its use of balancing parameter) associated with our IEEE SPL paper:

W. Xiong, C. Schindelhauer and H. C. So, "Error-Reduced Elliptic Positioning via Joint Estimation of Location and a Balancing Parameter," in IEEE Signal Processing Letters, vol. 29, pp. 2447-2451, 2022, doi: 10.1109/LSP.2022.3222952.

You could use the code for your comparisons at will, as long as the paper above is included as a reference in your manuscript.
